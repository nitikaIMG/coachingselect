                                          CoachingSelect will provide a platform for students to compare & Selects the best coaching according to their needs. Currently, students get enrolled themselves in any coaching randomly based on marketing advertisements or by the influence of their near dear ones.  They do not have the right platform to analyze and compare all the resources available nearby. As a result, approximately 30% of students quit in the first quarter of learning and 20% the student will continue only because there is no refund available.

                                       Today students get misled by false claims made by coaching centers and they have nothing to check the authenticity of the information and the true picture. They also fail to understand that a coaching center which otherwise gives good results might not be the right choice for them considering their preferences and aptitude.
